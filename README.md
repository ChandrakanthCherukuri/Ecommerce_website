Features

Shopping Cart Management:

Add items to your cart from product detail pages.

View all items in your cart with quantities and subtotals.

Adjust product quantities directly from the cart.

Modern & Aesthetic UI: A custom "Modern Dark & Lime" theme provides a unique and visually appealing interface.

Client-Side Routing: Smooth navigation between different sections of the application using React Router DOM.

Centralized State Management: Utilizes React Context API for managing authentication and shopping cart states efficiently.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing in React applications.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and custom theming.

Context API: React's built-in solution for global state management (Authentication, Cart).

Backend (Implied)
This frontend application is designed to interact with a separate backend API to fetch product data, handle authentication, and manage cart operations. (Specific backend technology not detailed in this README, assuming it's an external service).

Theme
The application boasts a custom "Modern Dark & Lime" theme, providing a unique and consistent visual identity. The theme uses a palette defined in tailwind.config.js:

primary-bg: #1a1a1a (Deep dark background)

secondary-bg: #2a2a2a (Slightly lighter dark for cards/sections)

dark-border: #444444 (Subtle dark borders)

light-text: #e0e0e0 (High contrast text)

medium-text: #b0b0b0 (Secondary text)

dark-text: #777777 (Subtle text for less emphasis)

accent-500: #CCFF66 (Vibrant lime green accent)

accent-600: #99CC33 (Darker lime for hover states)

Red shades are used for destructive actions (e.g., red-400, red-700).
